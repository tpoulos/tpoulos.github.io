    <strong>Read Me On Your Phone</strong>
    <p>Taylor Poulos
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <p>Read me on your phone
    <p>Wherever you are
    <p>A subway car
    <p>Your work
    <p class="indented">(Shhhhh, I won't tell)
    <p>Or at home
    <p>At a desk
    <p>In a chair
    <p>On the couch
    <p>Hunched over food
    <p>With your screen face on
  </div>


  <div class="stanza">
    <p>Read me on your phone
    <p>Because it's the only place you read anything anymore
    <p>That’s not quite true
    <p>I’m sorry
    <p>You still read books, sometimes
    <p>You still go to the library
    <p class="indented">(like you go to the gym)
  </div>


  <div class="stanza">
    <p>Read me on your phone because screens are strong
    <p>I keep you up at night
    <p>I glow
    <p>I can handle a tumble down stairs
    <p class="indented">(Not that you’d let me)
    <p>You cradle me in your hands
    <p>Touch me only with the pads of our fingers
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <p>Read me on your phone because it's comfortable
    <p>The words are mine
    <p>But the screen is yours
    <p>And you know me
    <p>Every pixel
    <p>Every scratch
    <p>I have a kingdom of 400 by 700 pixels
    <p>I know you're running iOS
    <p>I know that you have 75% of your battery left
    <p>I know that you’ve only seen me here for a few minutes
    <p>But I can't control how my lines break
    <p>I don't even know what font I am
    <p>It's embarassing
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <p>I am on the screen you use
    <p>To talk with the people you love
    <p>I am in your space and at your fingertips
    <p>It's almost intimate
    <p>You're touching me,
    <p>And we've only just met
    <p>You can flick me away, but don’t! You’re all that I have.
