  Overmoyer Bicycles

<div class="article-body wrapper">
  <p> This project started as a case study for the class 67-250. Students were tasked with creating a retail Point of Sale device (POS) that would revitalize Overmoyer Bicycles, a fictional bicycle company with an aging but significant retail presence.

  <p> My team analyzed the case study and proposed that the company use tablets in their physical storefronts. However, in contrast to the way they are used in most stores (as glorified digital sinage), we wanted the tablet to be central to the retail experience, and an object that would bring salespeople and customers closer together.

  <p> We designed and prototyped a POS System to meet these goals.

  <p> [NOTE: because of the complexity of the swipe gestures, we prototyped in HTML and CSS. The screenshots below were taken in Mobile Safari, however the finished app would most likely be a native app. You can see the code in a <a href="https://github.com/tpoulos/IS_group_project">github repo</a>.]

  <p> First, customers could use the POS to browse the bicycles physically present in the store. Rather than replacing the salespeople or the store experience, the information in the tablets was meant to add to the experience by provding information you normally couldn't find. For example, customer reviews and specifications of the bikes, as well as other similar models.

  <p> In addition to browsing, the tablets contained features that the salesmen could use to process transactions and collect customer information. These screens were hidden behind a secret passcode: a swipe gesture that only the salespeople would know about.
