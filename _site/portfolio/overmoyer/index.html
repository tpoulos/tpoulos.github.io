  Overmoyer Bicycles
</div>


<div class="article-body wrapper">
  <p> This project started as a case study for the class 67-250. Students were tasked with creating a retail Point of Sale device (POS) that would revitalize Overmoyer Bicycles, a fictional bicycle company with an aging retail presence.

  <p> My team analyzed the case study and proposed that the company use tablets in their physical storefronts. However, in contrast to the way they are used in most stores (as glorified digital sinage), we wanted the tablet to be central to the retail experience, and an object that would bridge the gap between salespeople and customers.

  <p> We designed and prototyped a POS System to meet these goals.

  <p> As of the time of this projects, tablets  used in many retail stores. Their usage fell into one of three categories. The first category was that of sinage: they were sat next to objects in the store, allowing users to tap around and look at information that might otherwise have been put in a printed book. The second category was functional: often stores provided salespeople with tablets to perform routine tasks such as checking inventory or performing transactions. The third group of users were cusomers bringing their own mobile devices into a store to access unbiased reviews, perform price comparison, and learn more about the devices in the showroom.

  <p> In our discussions, we realized that a bike showroom is a great place for all three of these behaviors were important to a bike shop. Bikes have a wide variety of specs that are often attached the the handlebars in small, hard to read booklets, and digitizing those booklets might make them more readable and user-friendly.

  <p> Similarly, salespeople should be able to perform basic tasks, such as collecting customer information and checking them out, without going to a fixed point of sale unit. Bike shops are often large and sprawling, and having a fixed sales counter often didn't make as much sense.

  <p> Finally, customers clearly want access to unbiased reviews, as a bikes are a long-term investment, with plenty of moving parts that can break or go wrong, often with dangerous results.

  <p> However, we wanted to take all three of these tasks one step further. Rather than having separate computer systems for each of these tasks, what if the salespeople and the customers shared the same mobile device? Such a system of floating tablets would not only save the company money and allow a richer shopping experience, but the act of physically passing a device back and forth may actually bring customers and salespeople closer together. Rather than an imbalanced customer/salesperson relationsip, they would share the same device, sharing ownership over the transaction.

  <p> We prototyped this system in HTML and CSS. You can see the code in our <a href="https://github.com/tpoulos/IS_group_project">github repo.</a>

  <p> In addition to browsing, the tablets contained features that the salesmen could use to process transactions and collect customer information. These screens were hidden behind a secret passcode: a swipe gesture that only the salespeople would know about.
