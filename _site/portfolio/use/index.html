  Ultrasonic Echolocation
</div>

<div class="article-body wrapper">
  <p> USE (UltraSonic Echolocation) is an assistive technology for people with impaired middle-distance and peripheral vision. The system uses high-frequency sound, enabling the user to echolocate without making a sound the people around them can hear.
  <p> But first, some background. Although we normally associate echolocation with animals like bats and whales, some people have been able to use the technique to gain awareness of the objects around them, even enabling them to cross the street and ride bikes without assistance. There's even <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020162">some evidence</a> that this technique makes use of the visually impaired person's visual cortex, suggesting that<a href="http://www.livescience.com/14327-blind-people-echolocation-brains.html"> echolocation is similar to a sighted person's sensation of sight</a>.

  </div>
  <p> However, echolocation is not widely used in the visually impaired community. To understand why, imagine walking down a crowded city street, constantly clapping your hands or snapping your figures. The audible clicks required to echolocate draw attention, making many users feel stigmatized and uncomfortable.
  <p> Our system gets around these problems by using exclusively ultrasonic clicks, which the people around the wearer cannot hear. The device contains a speaker to produce the clicks, a microphone to record the clicks, and a pair of headphones to play the pitched down version of the clicks, which are audible only to the wearer. An onboard audio processing module does the pitching down process.
  <p> This video shows what it's like to use the device. The first section is what someone nearby would hear. The echolocation clicks are playing, but the observer cannot hear them because they are outside of the user's hearing range. The second section demonstrates what it is like to wear the USE headphones, and hear the pitched down version of the clicks.

  <p> We validated our concept using a number of tests, and confirmed that the supersonic waves that we used behaved in a similar way to the clicks used in echolocation.

  <p> We also built a proof of concept using off-the-shelf parts, including a Raspberry Pi.
