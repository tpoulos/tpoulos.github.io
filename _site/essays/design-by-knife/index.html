  Design by Knife
</div>


<div class="article-body wrapper">
  <p> Normally I think of design as an additive process. I start with a problem, and add the smallest smallest amount of complexity required to solve that problem.

  <p> My problem, in this case, is shoes. This is a hard problem. Shoes are hard. To me, shoes are an extension of my self, and as such they should reflect me. They're my point of contact with every place I go, my touchpoint to the world. They will mold to my body after a month of wear, they will learn the way I walk and the way my feet turn out. They must showcase my style and aesthetic sense and hold up to whatever level of athletisism I feel up to that day.

  <p> But most shoes don't do this. They aren't the minimum amount of complexity required to solve a problem: they are gaudy and ostentatious. Which isn't to say that I'm left without options. Oh boy are there options.

<div class="article-body wrapper">
  <p> Maybe I'm different than the average consumer, but to me the shoes on Amazon don't solve my problem.

  <p> But making shoes from scratch is hard, to the extent that I don't know where to start. I don't even know where to get the materials that go into making a shoe. And even if I could figure out where to get the materials, my first few shoes would suck because making shoes from scratch is an art.

  <p> But what if I didn't have to make it from scratch? In web development, hardly anyone codes from scratch anymore: we use templates. What I needed was a shoe template from which I could add or subtract as I liked.

  <p>Instead of design by addition (my normal process) this would be design by knife. I would buy a pair of shoes and strip out the complexity that I didn't like. In the end, I would be left with a perfectly servicable shoe that solves my problem.

<div class="article-body wrapper">
  <p> As my template, I chose a pair of Adidas Sambas. The boy I had a crush on in highschool wore them, and because of that I consider Sambas the ultimate in style, class, and sophistication. They're also damn comfortable, and cheap if you know where to get them. You may think this is superficial or misguided, but where do you think our tastes come from if not from what we thought was cool in high school?

  <p> But as much as I like Sambas, they have major flaws. For one, Adidas's branding is ludicrus. If I wanted to look like a jock, I would wear bro-tanks and drink muscle milk. Besides, I don't like the idea of wearing a multinational corporation's logo wherever I go: Adidas doesn't need the free advertising. And there are other issues as well, namely that the laces are too long.

  <p> Although I started by thinking that the process would be easy, it was far from straightforward. The hardest part, of course, was removing the stripes, but the stripes are carefully integrated into the shoe's structure. I needed to be very careful with an x-acto knife to remove them without damaging the shoe.

  <p> Similarly, removing the gold foil on the side required some looking around. A google search revealed that I needed nail polish remover, which was frighteningly effective at removing the decoration.

  <p> Finally, to fix the laces I tied the shoes and cut off the leftover material. If I left the ends like this, the laces would fray and gradually come unraveled, so I borrowed an old lacrosse player's trick and used a lighter to melt the plastic ends of the laces. This effectively seals them and keeps the ends from fraying.

<div class="article-body wrapper">
  <p> It feels wrong to take a knife to something you've just bought. It's like swearing in front of a baby. You know it doesn't do any harm, but you can't help but feel like you're ruining something special.

<div class="article-body wrapper">
  <p> The shoes, when finished, look very different. They are still as comfortable and durable as normal Sambas, and they have the same sillouette, but there's something unnerving at looking at shoes without any brand. Normally, sneaker brands are obnoxious, but when you remove them completely the shoe feels sleek.

  <p> And I didn't stop at my shoes. I've taken a knife to my new backpack as well. People ask me if it was expensive (it wasn't) or if it's an obscure european brand (it's Burton, the top hit on Amazon.)

<div class="article-body wrapper">
  <p>I'm a little worried I'll never stop. Maybe I'll become a capitalist Dr. Mengele, mutilating the things that I buy for my own sick pleasure.

  <p> But I think that this approach is more transformational than that. It's been said that "simplicity is the ultimate in sophistication," and I wonder if products like sneakers and backpacks are intentionally designed with kitch in mind. By adding obnoxuious logos and extra little patches, the products feel more comfortable. Without the kitch the product feels more spohisticated, but it's unlikely that they would sell as well as the more decorated colleagues. My shoes and backpack are interesting <em>because</em> they're different, not because plain products are inherently superior.
