  Ultrasonic Echolocation
</div>

<div class="article-body wrapper">
  <p> USE (UltraSonic Echolocation) is an assistive technology for people with impaired middle-distance and peripheral vision. The system uses high-frequency sound, enabling the user to echolocate without making a sound the people around them can hear.
  <p> But first, some background. Although we normally associate echolocation with animals like bats and whales, some people have been able to use the technique to gain awareness of the objects around them, even enabling them to cross the street and ride bikes without assistance. There's even <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020162">some evidence</a> that this technique makes use of the visually impaired person's visual cortex, suggesting that<a href="http://www.livescience.com/14327-blind-people-echolocation-brains.html"> echolocation is similar to a sighted person's sensation of sight</a>.

  <p> However, echolocation is not widely used in the visually impaired community. To understand why, imagine walking down a crowded city street, constantly clapping your hands or snapping your figures. The audible clicks required to echolocate draw attention, making many users feel stigmatized and uncomfortable.
  <p> Our system gets around these problems by using exclusively ultrasonic clicks, which the people around the wearer cannot hear. The device contains a speaker to produce the clicks, a microphone to record the clicks, and a pair of headphones to play the pitched down version of the clicks, which are audible only to the wearer. An onboard audio processing module does the pitching down process.

  <p> We also built a proof of concept using off-the-shelf parts, including a raspberry pi.
