  <p> As part of the class 67-373, I worked with the <a href="https://www.pittsburghparks.org">Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy</a> on a mobile app redesign, as a part of a four person team. I worked as project manager, and helped design and develop the iOS application.
  <p> Pittsburgh Parks had a mobile app developed several years ago by an outside contractor, but the project ran out of money before it was completed and the app did not meet their expecations. We worked with them to develop an app that suited their needs, while taking advantage of the considerable time and resource investment they had already made in the project.
  <p> This project had a large number of contstraints. Most importantly, we were constrained by the previous work that had gone into the project: we had to conform to the existing backend the previous contractors had developed. Our team was also constrained by our development skill. None of us were experienced iOS developers, and only two members had encountered Android app development.
  <p> In developing our app, we stuck very close to stock android and iOS patterns, while keeping the experience consistent between both platforms. The two apps are live in the app store, and our client had this to say about working with us:


  <blockquote>Iâ€™ve said it before, but thank you all SO MUCH for your brilliant work this semester. I already knew that you all did an incredible job, but was extra proud on Friday getting to see the parks app beside those other projects. Parks and Rec was the best group, hands down.</blockquote>

  <p> In keeping with iOS 7 design patterns, we flattened out the app icon, while still keeping it recognizable.

  <p> Before creating high fidelity mockups, we went over two rounds of wireframes with the clients. We chose to work with iOS, at least at this stage, and then port the iOS design patterns to android.

  <p> Whenever possible, we demoed our mockups on real devices. Before releasing the app, we also took the time to use it in the environment we expect our users to encounter the app (a park), and brainstormed with the client ways to make the app better in the future.
