  <p> As part of the class 67-373, I worked with the <a href="https://www.pittsburghparks.org">Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy</a> (PPC) on a redesign of their Android and iOS apps. I worked as the project manager of the four person team, and as a designer and iOS developer.
  <p> The application we were redesigning had been developed several years ago by an outside contractor, but the project had ran out of money before it was completed, and the app did not meet the PPC&rsquo;s expectations. As our clients, we worked with them to redesign and develop an app that:
  <ul>
    <li>Helps pittsburgh residents find their way around the city&rsquo;s five major parks.</li>
    <li>Collects donations for the PPC</li>
    <li>Directs pittsburgh residents to the PPC&rsquo;s social media accounts</li>
  </ul>
  <p> In addition to the required features, this project had a large number of contstraints. We had to conform to the backend that the previous developers had designed, and that the PPC had populated with park information. Our team was also constrained time and by our skills. None of us were experienced iOS developers, and only two members had encountered Android app development.
  <p> In order to make the project simpler and more maintainable, we stuck very closely to standard iOS and Android UI elements.

  <p> We flattened out the app icon to be consistent iOS 7&rsquo;s aesthetic.

  <p> Before creating high fidelity mockups, we went over two rounds of wireframes with the clients. We chose to work with iOS, at least at this stage, and then port the iOS designs to android.

  <p> Whenever possible, we demoed our mockups on real devices. Before releasing the app, we also tested the app in a park, and brainstormed with the client ways to make the app better in the future.

  <p>The two apps are live in the app store, and our client had this to say about working with us:

  <blockquote>Iâ€™ve said it before, but thank you all SO MUCH for your brilliant work this semester. I already knew that you all did an incredible job, but was extra proud on Friday getting to see the parks app beside those other projects. Parks and Rec was the best group, hands down.
