  Parks Conservancy

<div class="article-body wrapper">
  <p> As part of the class 67-373, I worked with the <a href="https://www.pittsburghparks.org">Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy</a> (PPC) on a redesign of their Android and iOS apps. I worked as the project manager of the four person team, and as a designer and iOS developer.

  <p> The PPC wanted an app that would make it easier for Pittsburgh residents to experience the parks. This meant removing what their own research identified as the biggest barrier to entry in parks: not knowing what to expect before they came to the parks, and not being able to navigate the parks once they got there. In addition, they wanted to encourage residents to interact with the PPC, either by connecting to the PPC on social media or by collecting donations.

  <p><strong>Goals </strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Inform Pittsburgh residents about the city&rsquo;s five major parks.</li>
    <li>Help residents find their way around the parks.</li>
    <li>Collect donations for the PPC.</li>
    <li>Direct residents to the PPC&rsquo;s social media accounts.</li>
  </ol>

  <p> In addition to the required features, this project had a large number of constraints. We had to conform to the backend that the previous developers had designed, and that the PPC had populated with park information. Our team was also constrained time and by our skills. None of us were experienced iOS developers, and only two members had encountered Android app development.

  <p> We flattened out the app icon to be consistent iOS 7&rsquo;s aesthetic.

  <p> Before creating high fidelity mockups, we went over two rounds of wireframes with the clients. This put us on the same page about what we were building, and defined the project scope. We also got tons of great feedback from our clients, all of whom are avid park goers and smartphone users.

  <p> We then moved into high fidelity.

  <p> Because our team was inexperienced, we decided to stick as closely to "stock iOS" as possible, which would make the project simpler and more maintainable. Although this ran the risk of making the project feel generic, we felt that it was more important for the app to feel familiar on both iOS and Android, rather than heavily branded and uncomfortable to use.

  <p>The two apps are live in the app store, and our client had this to say about working with us:

  <blockquote>Thank you all SO MUCH for your brilliant work this semester. I already knew that you all did an incredible job, but was extra proud [watching your demo] on Friday. Parks and Rec was the best group, hands down.
