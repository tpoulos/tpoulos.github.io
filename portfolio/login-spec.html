  <p> This is a specification for the expii login system.

  <p>The quality of a design is worthless if it doesn’t get built properly. I rarely see specs in a designer&rsquo;s portfolio, and I think that&rsquo;s a bad thing. I spend most of my time communicating with others, and a spec is an artifact of this communication.

<div class="article-body wrapper">
  <p>Over time, I’ve come to appreciate the power of a good spec; both to communicate all of the design decisions I’ve made to an engineer and as a tool to help me clarify my own thought process, and help me find all of the edge cases of the designs I've made.

  <p>Although a spec might seem like purely the creation of a designer, in reality a spec represents the end of a long, iterative process. A lot of the spec is noting down the result of informal discussions I&rsquo;ve had with the engineer, and documenting our reasons for making those decisions.
