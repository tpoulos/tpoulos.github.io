  <p>For a maker day project and then a maker week project, I worked with developers and newsroom reps on a complete refresh of an internal bookmarklet.
  <p>The bookmarklet collected information that editors would otherwise have to visit many internal tools to see, speeding up their work. But, it had been in use for several years without significant penetration, and had a quirky way of showing data.
  <p>As part of the process of converting the bookmarklet to a Chrome extension, I cleaned up and organized the design.
