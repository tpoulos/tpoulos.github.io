  Design by Knife

<div class="article-body wrapper">
  <p> Normally I think of design as an additive process. I start with a problem, and add the smallest smallest amount of complexity required to solve that problem.

  <p> My problem, in this case, is shoes. This is a hard problem. Shoes are hard. To me, shoes are an extension of my self, and as such they should reflect me. They're my point of contact with every place I go, my touchpoint to the world. They will mold to my body after a month of wear, they will learn the way I walk and the way my feet turn out. They must showcase my style and aesthetic sense and hold up to whatever level of athletisism I feel up to that day.

  <p> But most shoes don't do this. They aren't the minimum amount of complexity required to solve a problem: they are gaudy and ostentatious. Which isn't to say that I'm left without options. Oh boy are there options.

  <p> Maybe I'm different than the average consumer, but to me the shoes on Amazon don't solve my problem.

  <p> As a designer, I feel like I should be able to solve this problem, after all, how hard can making a pair of shoes be? Very hard, to the extent that I don't know where to start. I don't even know where to get the materials that go into making a shoe. And even if I could figure all that out, my first few shoes would suck, because shoe making is an art that requires practice.

  <p> Making a shoe from scratch was out of the question, but what if I didn't have to make it from scratch? In web development, hardly anyone codes from scratch anymore, we use templates. What I needed was a shoe template, from which I could add or subtract as I liked.

  <p>Instead of design by addition (my normal process) this would be design by knife. I would buy a shoe and strip out the complexity that I didn't like. In the end, I would be left with a perfectly servicable shoe that solves my problem.



  <p> The boy I had a crush on in highschool wore them, and as such I consider Adidas Sambas the ultimate in style, class, and sophistication. They're also damn comfortable, and cheap if you know where to get them. You may think this is superficial or misguided, but where do you think our tastes come from, if not from our upbringing?

  <p> But as much as I like Sambas, they have major flaws. For one, Adidas's branding is ludicrus. If I wanted to look like a jock, I would wear bro-tanks and drink muscle milk. Besides, I don't like the idea of wearing a multinational corporation's logo wherever I go. I don't like providing free advertising. And there are other issues as well, namely that the laces are too long.

  <p> Although I started by thinking that the process would be easy, it was far from straightforward. The hardest part, of course, was removing the stripes, but the stripes are carefully integrated into the shoe's structure. I needed to be very careful with an x-acto knife to remove them without damaging the shoe.

  <p> Similarly, removing the gold foil on the side was tricky. I scraped for a while, but didn't get anywhere. A google search revealed that I needed nail polish remover, which was frighteningly effective at removing the decoration.

  <p> Finally, to fix the laces I tied the shoes and cut the material off that was left over. If I left it like this, the laces would fray and gradually come unraveled, so I borrowed an old lacrosse player's trick and used a lighter to melt the plastic ends of the laces. This effectively seals them and keeps the ends from fraying.

  <p> It feels wrong to take a knife to something you've just bought, like swearing in front of a baby. You know it doesn't do any harm, but you can't help but feel like you're ruining something special.



  <p> The shoes, when finished, look very different. They are still as comfortable and durable as normal Sambas, and they have the same sillouette, but there's something unnerving at looking at shoes without any brand. Normally, sneaker brands are very obvious, but when you remove them completely the shoe feels sleaker, almost clandestine.


  <p> And I didn't stop at my shoes. I've taken a knife to my new backpack as well. The backpack came out very well. People ask me if it was expensive (it wasn't) or if it's an obscure european brand (it's Burton, the top hit on Amazon.) I'm a little worried I'll never stop. Maybe I'll become a capitalist Dr. Mengle, mutilating the things that I buy for my own sick pleasure.

  <p> But I think that this approach is more fundamental than that. It's been said that "simplicity is the ultimate in sophistication," and I wonder if products like sneakers and backpacks are intentionally designed with kitch in mind. By adding obnoxuious logos and extra little patches, the designers make products that feel comfortable. By removing that kitch, I'm creating a more sophisticated product.
