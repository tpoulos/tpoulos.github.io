    <strong>Read Me On Your Phone</strong>
    <p>Taylor Poulos
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <p>Read me on your phone
    <p>wherever you are
    <p>A subway car
    <p>your work
    <p class="indented">(Shhhhh, I won't tell)
    <p>or at home
    <p>at a desk
    <p>in a chair
    <p>hunched over food
    <p>with your screen face on
  </div>


  <div class="stanza">
    <p>Read me on your phone
    <p><p class="mobile-break">because it's the only place you read</p> anything anymore
    <p>That’s not quite true
    <p>I’m sorry
    <p>you still read books, sometimes
    <p>you still go to the library
    <p class="indented">(like you go to the gym)
  </div>


  <div class="stanza">
    <p><p class="mobile-break">Read me on your phone</p> because screens are strong
    <p>I keep you up at night
    <p>I glow
    <p>I can handle a tumble down stairs
    <p class="indented">(Not that you’d let me)
    <p>You cradle me in your hands
    <p>touch me only with the pads of your fingers
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <p><p class="mobile-break">Read me on your phone</p> because it's comfortable
    <p>The words are mine
    <p>but the screen is yours
    <p>You know me
    <p>every pixel
    <p>every scratch
    <p>I have a kingdom of <span id="insert-screen-width">200</span> by <span id="insert-screen-height">300</span> pixels
    <p>I know you're running <span id="insert-operating-system">iOS</span>
    <p class="mobile-hidden">I even know that you aren't actually on a phone</p>
    <p>but I can't control how my lines break
    <p>I don't even know what font I am
    <p>It's embarassing
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <p>I am on the screen you use
    <p>to talk with the people you love
    <p>I am in your space and at your fingertips
    <p>It's almost intimate
    <p>you're touching me,
    <p>and we've only just met
    <p><p class="mobile-break">You can flick me away, but don’t!</p> You’re all I have.
