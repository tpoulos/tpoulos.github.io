  <h2 class="title">My Whole Deal</h2>
  <p>I’m a generalist digital product designer. I like seeing the whole process; from definition to research to detailed design to seeing an actual screen in somebody’s hand.
  <p>I graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2016 with a triple major in Human-Computer Interaction, Information Systems, and Creative Writing.
  <p>Right now I'm at The New York Times, where I'm on the team for NYT Parenting. I've also worked at Axios, where I designed for the public-facing website, mobile app, and reporter-facing tools.
  <p>As a designer I’m most at home on UX focused projects. I love product definition, user research, wireframing, and the kind of design problems that require you to make a spreadsheet. I also value seeing my work through to completion, and can deliver on high-fidelity visual design.
  <p>One of my favorite parts of the job is working closely with engineers. I have enough software engineering background to effectively communicate, and actually enjoy reworking designs so that they can be built quickly and robustly.
